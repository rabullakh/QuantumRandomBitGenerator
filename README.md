# Quantum Random Bit Generator

This project simulates a quantum random bit generator using MATLAB. It models a single qubit in a superposition state and generates random bits based on quantum measurement probabilities.

## Features
- Initializes a qubit in an equal superposition state
- Simulates 10 random measurements
- Outputs a random bit sequence
- Visualizes bit distribution with a histogram

## Technologies
- MATLAB

## How to Run
1. Open `quantum_random_bit_generator.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to generate a sequence of 10 random bits.
3. View the histogram output for bit distribution.

## Output Example
```
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1
```
